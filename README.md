How to install the app and associated tests
-------

* Clone the repository and cd into the directory https://github.com/AlinaGoaga/rps-challenge
* Run bundle to install the gems
* Use rackup to start the server 
* Go to http://localhost:9292 and enjoy playing!
* There are both feature tests (using Capabybara) and unit tests (using Rspec) included. Use rspec to run these. 

Implemented functionality 
-------
* At the moment one player is accepted. The player inserts their name, chooses one of the three options (rock, paper, scissors) after which the computer generates a random option as well. The winner is decided based on the below rules:

Rules                | 
------------------   |
Rock beats Scissors  | 
Scissors beats Paper | 
Paper beats Rock     |

* Moving forward, functionality allowing a second player will be implemented.
